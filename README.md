# RSA Encryption Project
Implemented using MATLAB®
## Project Description 
MATLAB based project for implementing RSA technique for encryption.\
Done for Discrete Mathematics course as a final course project in partial satisfaction of the total course grade.

## Tips
1. The file *__main.m__* is where the encryption can be done.
2. The *__main.m__* file is calling scripts for each part written in different scripts.
3. Most of the functions are self-implemented, and no built-in functions are used. 
4. The text needed to be encrypted is entered in *__message.txt__* file, and the encrypted message is saved into "cypertext.txt" file. 
5. For the file named *__decypertext.txt__*, it contains the text after the decryption process.
