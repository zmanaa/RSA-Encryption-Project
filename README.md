# RSA Encryption Project
Implemented using MATLAB®
## Project Description 
MATLAB based project for implementing RSA technique for encryption.
Done for Discrete Mathematics course as a final course project in partial satisfaction of the total course grade.

## Tips
1 - The file "main.m" is where the encryption can be done.
2 - The "main.m" file is calling scripts for each part written in different scripts.
3 - Most of the functions are self-implemented, and no built-in function are used. 
4 - The text needed to be encrypted is entered in "message.txt" file, and the encrypted message is saved into "cypertext.txt" file. 
5 - For the file named "decypertext.txt", it contains the text after the decryption process.
